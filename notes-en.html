The first is "Guide", this is the teacher's view and there is a script to follow. The second is "Explore", this is where students join after the teacher starts the Tour on his/her device. In addition to Google Expeditions, there are a number of other YouTube 360 degree videos that you can access with your students. Just search "360 Degree Videos for Education" on YouTube.

If you want to have students make their own 360 videos it is easy with a 360 degree camera (Example: RICOH THETA or Samsung 360 camera)or devices that have 360 degree camera apps installed (Example: 360 Panorama).

Google Expeditions provides a script for the teacher or tour guide to read that only appears on the device of the instructor. CAUTION: Using the devices in viewers may not be possible for people with epilepsy or motion sickness. One way to be inclusive is to have people who don't want to use the viewers use an iPad and access the gyroscope feature to view the trip. Classroom Tip: Have younger students put the device upside down in "polite mode" while you are talking about the expedition to ensure they are listening.</td>

Teachers have the option to assign specific projects from the CoSpaces library or allow students to create their own environments based on a lesson.

        * While working through the Create-Along, open up a new CoSpaces space in another tab and create after each step - OR -
        * You can use the slides more as a reference and teach in your CoSpaces project. That way the learners will be able to see in action all the different tools and tricks.
        * Don't forget to click on Play (play icon in top right corner) to preview in order to see your space develop as you go.
        * While in Edit Mode click on the camera and show how the field of view lights up. Make sure to show the participants that if you want to see your objects as soon as play mode starts then they have to be in the field of view or the camera. You can click on Play Mode to ensure your objects are in a good position.

                      If the learners make changes to their spaces on the computers and want to see the changes in the VR headsets, then will need to reopen their spaces on the phone. They simply press the "Home" button in the top left corner, then choose their space again.
                      Give the learners about 10 mins each to test out their creation. It will give them a sense of how what they created relates to the project in VR space. This will be helpful in the next work sessions as they are adding code. They will have a better sense of how things in the VR headsets differ from on the computer screen.
